# snip-it
✂️
snip-it is a note-amassing tool for people who code.  
✂️
Designed for visual learners, snip-it strips away as many words as possibe to make each entry lead with
associated tags and a code snippet (or image of whiteboard).  Adittionally, the saveing of an entry requires the 
coder to leave a meaningful description of the snip, thereby forcing one to think about what is happening in 
the snippet and creating some mental connections in the process.
